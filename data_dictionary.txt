# Data dictionary for Panels Project

## Table of Contents
1. `metadata.xlsx` dictionary
2. `pcover.csv` dictionary
3. `data_community.xlsx` dictionary

### 1. metadata.xlsx
note that script `R/cover_data_metadata.R` changes aspects of the metadata table. See `change_log.txt`.
##### columns
- "Site Code" -- unique code for each site that is used throughout the dataset. This is used to join data tables. _Note that "Site Code" is changed to "site" for data analysis_
- "Site" -- A more descriptive verion of the site code with place names written out. 
- "Lat" - site latitude in decimal degrees
- "Long" - site longitude in decimal degrees
- "Date Range - 30 days" - month and day range for the sampling on day 30. All years are 2021
- "Date Range - 60 days" - month and day range for the sampling on day 60. All years are 2021
- "Date Range - 90 days" - month and day range for the sampling on day 90. All years are 2021
- "Salinity - 30 days" - salinity sampled at day 30
- "Salinity - 60 days" - salinity sampled at day 60
- "Salinity - 90 days" - salinity sampled at day 90
- "Temperature - 30 days" - temperature (Celsius) sampled at day 30
- "Temperature - 60 days" - temperature (Celsius) sampled at day 60
- "Temperature - 90 days" - temperature (Celsius) sampled at day 90


### 2. `pcover.csv` dictionary
pcover = percent cover as measured through 100 point counts on each plate
##### columns
- "Panel ID" - a combination of year, site code, sampling day, and panel number
- "Site" - the site code used throughout the dataset
- "Age" - sampling day
- "Site_Age" - combination of "Site" and "Age"
- "Algae_brown":"Forams" - taxonomic groups identified in point count surveys
- "Open space" - a separate estimate open/bare/available space for settlement on panels
- "Sediment" - an estimate of sediment cover on panels

### 3. `data_community.xlsx` dictionary
this table contains processed data from the study, inlcuding from point count data and a separate taxon/species list made at most sites
##### columns
- "ID" - unique plate ID, same as "Panel ID" in pcover data above
- "site" - the site code used throughout the dataset
- "temp" - tempreature in Celsius for each sampling day at each site
- "rugosity" - a measure of topographic rugosity based on 3-dimensional models created for each panels from photos (structure from motion). This value ranges from 0 to 1, where 1 is a perfectly flat surface
- "salinity" - salinity for each sampling day at each site
- "richness" - an estimate of taxonomic/species richness based on point counts and a separate species list generated for each site based on visual inspection of photos by Dean Janiak
- "s_diversity" - Shannon diversity measure for genus level identification
