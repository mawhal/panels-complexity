Latitudinal gradients

- for richness, diversity, redundancy, rugosity
- against temperature
- by date likely most relevant


ordinations -  back-burner for now - discuss how we want to do this.
- 

models with new richness and diversity data


Need to update the data dictionary based on new data. 


## Remove low salinity sites?
- remove for trends


# Title:

- topic - biogeogrpahy of diversity-complexity relationship
- title - There is or is not one (we think there is a relationship)
- depends on speed of communities
- a diversity-complexity relationship emerges at the biogeographic scale in marine fouling communities
- 


### Questions for Dean
- check Sh_diversity measures that are zero when richness > 1 (is open space counted as a species? Let's fix this 
- this must be because additional species were counted after point counts 
- send over raw metadata file again?
- which site is USA-ALD? There are three listed in the metadata


# Temperature and Latitude
- not enough sites
- open ocean vs estuarine vs protected likely more important, but not enough samples of these different sites
- colder sites - include this in a model?
- linear relationships with latitude and temperature


# within vs across site relationships - 
- does the question change based on the scale - diversity and complexity

# decoupling of diversity-complexity relationship with competition
- how to think about age and competition
- cover as a covariate - or open space might make more sense - check biogeography patterns
- cover of arborescent bryozoans as a covariate as well.
- saturation happens -> decoupling

## structure of paper
- biogeographic gradient in diversity (richness + shannon)
- faceted graph with rugosity and richness and shannon
- within sites graph (rugosity ~ shannon faceted)

# models to present
- separate models for richness and diversity

Discussion points
- high recrutiment or growth - saturate space and compeition can take over
- certain species that can overgrow others, some will be high complexity, other low complexity
-
